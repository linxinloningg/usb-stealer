Description
===========

IE PassView is a small utility that reveals the passwords stored by
Internet Explorer Web browser. It supports all versions of Internet
Explorer, from version 4.0 and up to 11.0, as well as Microsoft Edge
Browser.
For each password that is stored by Internet Explorer, the following
information is displayed: Web address, Password Type (AutoComplete,
Password-Protected Web Site, or FTP), Storage Location (Registry,
Credentials File, or Protected Storage), and the user name/password pair.
You can select one or more items from the passwords list and export them
into text/html/csv/xml file.
IE PassView also allows you to extract the passwords of Internet Explorer
and Microsoft Edge from external hard drive.



Versions History
================


* Version 1.42
  o Added option to choose another font (name and size) to display in
    the main window.
  o The download zip file is now password-protected.

* Version 1.41
  o Added NoHistoryRead entry to the .cfg file. If you set it to 1,
    IE PassView won't read the history database for decrypting the
    passwords. This option is useful for the combination of IE11 and
    Windows 7 because IE PassView may hang or crash if the history
    database is not flushed to disk completely.
  o You can use /NoHistoryRead from command-line to turn off the
    history reading of IE11:
    iepv.exe /NoHistoryRead

* Version 1.40
  o Added support for decrypting IE passwords from external drive for
    recent versions of Windows and IE, including Windows 10, IE10, IE11,
    and Microsoft Edge.
  o For IE7 - IE9 and IE10/IE11 under Windows 7 - IE PassView now
    reads the Registry file (ntuser.dat) directly instead of loading it
    as additional Registry hive.

* Version 1.35
  o Finally... Fixed a crash problem occurred on some Windows 10
    systems (The problem occurred if you added Gmail or other email
    account into Windows 10 Mail application).

Types Of Passwords
==================

IE PassView utility can recover 3 types of passwords:
* AutoComplete Passwords: When you enter a Web page that contains a
  form with user/password fields and a login button, Internet Explorer
  may ask you if you want to save the password, after pressing the login
  button. If you choose to save the password, the password is saved as
  AutoComplete password.
  Be aware that some Web sites (like Yahoo login page) deliberately
  disable the AutoComplete feature, in order to avoid password stealing
  by other users.
* HTTP Authentication Passwords: Some Web sites allow the user to enter
  only after typing user and password in a separated dialog-box. If you
  choose to save the password in this login dialog-box, the password is
  saved as HTTP authentication password.
* FTP Passwords: Simply the passwords of FTP addresses (ftp://...)




Password Storage Locations
==========================

Internet Explorer stores the passwords in different locations, depending
on the version of IE, and the type of the password:
* Protected Storage: The 'Protected Storage' is a special secret
  location in the Registry that was used to store all the passwords of
  Internet Explorer in versions 4.0 - 6.0
  The Registry location of the Protected Storage was
  HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Protected Storage System Provider.
  Starting from version 7.0 of Internet Explorer, the Protected Storage
  is no longer used for storing passwords.
* Registry (Storage2 Key): Starting from version 7.0 of IE, all
  AutoComplete passwords are stored in
  HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Internet
  Explorer\IntelliForms\Storage2 Registry key. The passwords are
  encrypted with a key created from the Web site address, so it's not
  possible to get the password without knowing the Web site address.
* Credentials File: Starting from version 7.0 of IE, HTTP
  authentication passwords are saved in the Credentials file of Windows,
  together with other network/login passwords. The Credentials file is
  located in the following locations:
  o Windows XP/2003: [Windows Profile]\Application
    Data\Microsoft\Credentials\[User SID]\Credentials and [Windows
    Profile]\Local Settings\Application Data\Microsoft\Credentials\[User
    SID]\Credentials
  o Windows Vista: [Windows
    Profile]\AppData\Roaming\Microsoft\Credentials\[Random ID] and
    [Windows Profile]\AppData\Local\Microsoft\Credentials\[Random ID]




Known Issues With Internet Explorer 7.0/8.0/9.0
===============================================

Starting from version 7.0 of Internet Explorer, Microsoft completely
changed the way that passwords are saved. In previous versions (4.0 -
6.0), all passwords were saved in a special location in the Registry
known as the "Protected Storage".
In version 7.0 of Internet Explorer, passwords are saved in different
locations, depending on the type of password. Each type of passwords has
some limitations in password recovery:
* AutoComplete Passwords: These passwords are saved in the following
  location in the Registry: HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Internet
  Explorer\IntelliForms\Storage2
  The passwords are encrypted with the URL of the Web sites that asked
  for the passwords, and thus they can only be recovered if the URLs are
  stored in the history file. If you clear the history file, IE PassView
  won't be able to recover the passwords until you visit again the Web
  sites that asked for the passwords. Alternatively, you can add a list
  of URLs of Web sites that requires user name/password into the Web
  sites file (see below).
* HTTP Authentication Passwords: These passwords are stored in the
  Credentials file under Documents and Settings\Application
  Data\Microsoft\Credentials , together with login passwords of LAN
  computers and other passwords.
  Due to security limitations, IE PassView can recover these passwords
  only if you have administrator rights.



Known Issue With Delete Items
=============================

Be aware that when you have a Web site that has multiple stored
passwords, deleting the one of the passwords also remove all the other
passwords for the same Web site. The reason for that is that all the
passwords of a Web site are stored in the same entry.



Using The Web Sites File (iepv_sites.txt)
=========================================

As explained earlier, IE PassView won't be able to retrieve the
AutoComplete passwords of Internet Explorer 7.0 if the history of
Internet Explorer is cleared.
If you know the exact URLs of Web sites that store user name and
passowrd, you can add them into the Web Sites File - iepv_sites.txt, and
then IE PassView will retrieve the passwords even if the URL cannot be
found in the history file of Internet Explorer.
iepv_sites.txt is a simple text file that must be located in the same
folder of iepv.exe. The URLs in the file should be separated by CRLF
characters. A sample iepv_sites.txt file with a few URLs is already
provided with IE PassView.



Reading IE7 - IE11 passwords from external drive
================================================

Starting from version 1.15, you can also read the passwords stored by IE7
- IE11 from an external profile in your current operating system or from
another external drive (For example: from a dead system that cannot boot
anymore). In order to use this feature, you must know the last logged-on
password used for this profile, because the passwords are encrypted with
the SHA hash of the log-on password, and without that hash, the passwords
cannot be decrypted.
You can use this feature from the UI, by selecting the 'Advanced Options'
in the Options menu, or from command-line, by using /external parameter.
The user profile path should be something like "C:\Documents and
Settings\admin" in Windows XP/2003 or "C:\users\myuser" in Windows
Vista/2008.




Command-Line Options
====================



/no_pass_cred
Don't load the passwords stored in the Credentials file.

/no_pass_reg
Don't load the passwords stored in the Registry.

/no_pass_pstore
Don't load the passwords stored in the Protected Storage.

/external <User Profile Path> <Last Log-On Password>
Load the IE7 passwords from external drive/profile. For example:
iepv.exe /external "C:\Documents and Settings\admin" "MyPassword"



Translating IE PassView To Another Language
===========================================

IE PassView allows you to easily translate all menus, dialog-boxes, and
other strings to other languages.
In order to do that, follow the instructions below:
1. Run IE PassView with /savelangfile parameter:
   iepv.exe /savelangfile
   A file named iepv_lng.ini will be created in the folder of IE PassView
   utility.
2. Open the created language file in Notepad or in any other text
   editor.
3. Translate all menus, dialog-boxes, and string entries to the
   desired language.
4. After you finish the translation, Run IE PassView, and all
   translated strings will be loaded from the language file.
   If you want to run IE PassView without the translation, simply rename
   the language file, or move it to another folder.
